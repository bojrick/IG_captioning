Greetings Friends. I'm @conradclimber , leader of the 2012 National Geographic #everest expedition. While planning our expedition I suggested we post on Instagram the style that we all share .... in the moment, small vignettes of life with a few filters and effects just for fun. We will be sharing images from Nepal as we trek to #basecamp and on the mountain. If we are lucky we might even share from the summit! Thanks Natty G digital for trusting us with this unique opportunity. Please follow along as we climb our planet's highest peak. #oneverest This first image is of Ganesh, a Hindu god, Buddha and an owl. A wonderful reminder of peaceful co-existence.
